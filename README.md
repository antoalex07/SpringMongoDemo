# SpringMongoDemo
Spring Boot Application with MongoDB as database, A simple CRUD application 


This is a complete replica of the previous repository spring-boot-tutorial. The only difference is that I've changed the database from H2 to MongoDB, the video suggested that i change from H2 to MySQL but I was more comfortable with mongoDB so i changed to this. And when i tried to change in the previous projects there were multiple errors of which i could only solve a few. I was not able to gather any resources for the rest so I wrote this code since i was able to code through without copying from the previous code I would like to think that I was able to revise whatever I have learned.

Now I will continue with the testing part using Junit and Mockito
